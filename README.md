# Brawlhalla Health Overlay



This is an open-source Java application that can overlay the health of your opponents onto your screen. Since DLL injection in Java isn't really a thing, it achieves this by making itself an "always on top" window, and tricking windows into thinking a fullscreen application is on the top.

This version now uses less than 100MB at all times, less than 1% CPU on most machines) is coded much cleaner, and has a nicer UI.

 I've also added a smah bros insipired UI tool 
 Do try it


## How To Use

1. Download Java
2. Put the jar in a folder somewhere(literally anywhere)
3. Open the folder
4. Press F2 to close it.
